But i wasnt able to do that and kept on getting an error saying \"index out of range\". Which means the right and upright was causing the starting point to go out of bounds which also means i hadnt changed the starting point to the bottom left. This was before the professor gave an explanation. I than implemented the changes from the explantion but kept on getting \"index out of range error\". I commented out the position movement code."
